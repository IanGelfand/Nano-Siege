# 🛡️ Nano Siege

**Nano Siege** is my first game, built using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) as a submission for a game jam [GameDev.tv](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2025)

You play as a tiny warrior, shrunk down onto a tabletop dungeon surrounded by towering skeleton spectators.  
Your goal? Survive relentless waves of miniature skeleton warriors in an intense arena-style brawler!
